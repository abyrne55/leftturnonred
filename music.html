<h4 id="mists">The Mists of Time</h4>
<img src="images/album/mists.jpg" alt="image" width="530" height="515" />
<p><b>Mists of Time</b> A real memory or "flash back" from 1969-70. A collage of the day trips taken to the coast of Maine with friends from Bates College. Title song of CD is a reflection on my life.</p>

<p><b>Crisis</b> An early song written on the beach north of San Francisco in 1979. At the time, the world seemed to be deluged with conflict, especially in the Middle East. I expected to have to revise some of the lyrics in 1998, but not much has changed.</p>

<p><b>Must There Be a Sign</b> A song that could be applied to any spiritual or human relationship. You don't have to wear your feelings on your sleeve.</p>

<p><b>Never in the World</b> Utopian stream of consciousness that rocks.</p>

<p><b>Persion Version</b> Steve's song and a Seals favorite. I love the lyrics.</p>

<p><b>Paradise for Fools</b> Could be subtitled "Boston 1990." Reaction to violence, racism, and other problems facing the city at one of its low points.</p>

<p><b>Girl (I Love You)</b> A reflection on the changing complexities of long time relationships.</p>

<p><b>Change My Life</b> I look around and what do I see? My past and future life staring back at me.</p>

<p>A special thanks is in order to Brian Middleton, without whom these songs would not have been recorded. His patience with us musical mortals is much appreciated, as is his encouragement and friendship. Thanks, Brian!</p>

<p>The Cosmos Café album is in part me working through my midlife crisis while writing the songs for this project, which included things like turning 50 and the death of my father. As a result, it has, according to some listeners, a dark edge to it. I wrote the songs on acoustic guitar and most of the songs have a strong acoustic flavor as a result.</p>

<p><b>Another Crazy Day</b> is a song written in my head during some of the many stressful commutes to work, complete with congested roads and crazy drivers all rushing to get to their destinations on time. It is a reflection of the increasingly hectic lives we tend to live.</p>

<p><b>Why</b> is a cover of the b-side of a Byrds single which I've always liked in part because it has a bass part that I enjoy playing. The song also has nice 12-string playing by Brian.</p>

<p><b>Time to Move On</b> is a song some people believe is about the break up of a relationship, more specifically, my marriage. But it was intended to be a song about doing new and different things to stay young as one gets older. Life's too short to be stuck in a rut.</p>

<p><b>Sitting By My Window</b> was written, as the name suggests, sitting by my window. I was staring at the sky on a day with fast moving clouds, in some of which I saw human faces, which led to the fiction of the haunted woman.</p>

<p><b>I Can't Complain</b> is a commentary on the troubled times and pessimism that I felt in 2001 about the political, social, and economic events of the time and the personal tragedies of friends and relatives suffering or dying. Yet I woke up everyday and was far better off than most people. How could I complain?</p>

<p><b>Darkness Darkness</b> is a cover of a Youngbloods song written by Jesse Colin Young. I transformed it into a dirge.</p>

<p><b>Take a Chance</b> is a hodgepodge of several influences of sixties bands, with some remnants of the song being from my very first band in the sixties, and the ending influenced by the Turtles. Nice flute work by my daughter Elizabeth.</p>

<p><b>If I Die Tomorrow</b> is the direct result of the death of my father and how one begins to reflect upon one's own morality very strongly. Nice guitar work by Brian and flute again by Elizabeth.</p>

<h4 id="truth">Truth and Consequences</h4>
<img src="images/album/truth.jpg" alt="image" width="530" height="513" />
<p>My original intention for the third Left Turn on Red album was to write a White Album type of retrospection on my rock and roll history, covering the 1960s to present. I don't think this was achieved, but one can hopefully hear many of the artists who have influenced me over the past 40 years. The times we are currently living in, especially the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, have also had a heavy influence on many of the songs. Without apology, some good 'ole sixities activism and idealism permeates many of my lyrics. I hope you enjoy!</p>
<p><b>Mr. You're a Better Man Than I</b> Every band I have played in has played a Yardbirds song or two, so this project begins with a Yardbirds song with lyrics that are as relevant today as they were when they first were recorded in 1966.</p>
<p><b>Confessions</b> is just a rock and roll fantasy and a chance to play the blues.</p>
<p><b>Sleeping With the Enemy</b> is another storyboard with musical influences from The Who and The Dead.
  <p><b>I'm a Man</b> is a Spencer Davis song covered by Chicago, one I played a lot to myself throughout the years. Wah-wah orgy by Brice and fun to sing.</p>
  <p><b>Too Long</b> is an attempt to write a classic rock formula song iwth an early 80s feel.</p>
  <p><b>Homeless</b> was composed after reading one of the all too frequent newspaper articles about a homeless people who have died on the streets on under bridges and wondering what journey took them there. Musically, an attempt to recapture the simplicity of the early B52s.</p>
  <p><b>Holy Man</b> is a song for which you can thank the Moody Blues and George Harrison for, along with the revolution in Islam. All the emphasis on creating a religious utopia has created a lot of action, but not many answers.</p>
  <p><b>Not a Second Time</b> is focused on the theme of frustration. Could have been a campaign song for the 2004 election, but it still hold a lot of meaning today. "I think it's time that we're gone." How many more days?</p>
