<h2>Biographies</h2>
<p>Left Turn on Red is the platform for guitarist and vocalist Jim Glinski to record his original songs as well as some favorite covers. Created in the late 1980s, Left Turn on Red is heavily influenced by the musicians and bands of the 1960s and 1970s, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Grateful Dead, The Yardbirds, The Byrds, Tom Petty, The Moody Blues, The Jefferson Airplane, and Neil Young among others. Left Turn on Red is a studio band and has released three CDs: <i>The Mists of Time (1998)</i>, <i>Cosmos Café (2003)</i>, and most recently, <i>Truth and Consequences (2007)</i>. Aside from Jim Glinski, the other major contributor to Left Turn on Red is Brian Middleton, who has recorded, mixed, and performed on all three CDs.</p>

<h3>Main Band Members</h3>
<h4 id="glinski">Jim Glinski</h4>
<p>After seeing The Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, Jim, in the words of The Byrds, "Bought a guitar and learned how to play." Beginning with his first high school band, The Savages, Jim played guitar and bass, and also sang in many bands in New England throughout the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, including The Quick and the Dead, The Seals, and Urban Eyes. In the late 1980s, Jim began to write and record demos on a used 4-track porto studio at his house in Dorchester, Massachusetts, a Boston neighborhood. Around the same time, Brian Middleton, who played with Jim in The Seals, built a recording studio in the basement of his Dorchester home. The rest, as they say, is history.

<p>After graduating from college, Brian came to the Boston area to seek fame and fortune and began playing in a band in Hull, Massachusetts called The Seals, of which Jim was the bass player. A talented multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, and song writer, Brian has played in numerous bands, including The Seals, Time Pirates, The Rafters, and Purple Martin, which recorded a highly acclaimed CD, <i>Don't Tell James (1998)</i>. Today, Brian continues to perform actively with several bands, including Firefly and Catbasket. In the late 1980s, Brian built his own recording studio called NIKA (Not in Kansas Anymore), which today is known as Night Kitchen. It is here that all of the Left Turn on Red CDs have been recorded and mixed.</p>
